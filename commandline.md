# command-line cheatsheet
### Open image files from Terminal in Ubuntu
`eog <name of the image file> // You can use tab to auto-complete the filename.`
> Example
`eog test123.jpg & // This will open the test123 image file & retain control of the Terminal.`
The Terminal will hold the access as long as the application is open and you would not be able to do much on the terminal. Thus you can have the control of the terminal you can run the application in the background using " & " at the end of the command.
