### Open image files from Terminal in Ubuntu
```
eog eog http://lorempixel.com/900/450/sports/ & // Opens image in Image Viewer.
```
The Terminal will hold the access as long as the application is open and you would not be able to do much on the terminal. Thus you can have the control of the terminal you can run the application in the background using " & " at the end of the command.
